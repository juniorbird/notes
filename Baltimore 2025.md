## Things to do
### Fells Point

Fells Point is one of the oldest parts of Baltimore, with many buildings dating to the 18th century. It's right next to the harbor and will be just a few minutes from our hotel

Next to the Harbor, this area has great views and Baltimore's most famous market, but would be a long walk or short Uber of where we're staying.

### North Baltimore

This is where I grew up. We'd really have to get a car to go there. Mostly residential but has (like all parts of the city) its own market, plus an excellent museum.
